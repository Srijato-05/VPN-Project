## üîç Overview

This VPN client project is a cross-platform application written in Java and designed to interface with OpenVPN for secure communication. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to authenticate, select platform-specific configurations (such as Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux), and establish secure encrypted tunnels to VPN servers.

The VPN client is designed with both usability and security in mind, eliminating the need for command-line interaction. It fully supports ProtonVPN configuration files (.ovpn) and includes logging, platform dropdown selection, secure credential handling, and real-time feedback through GUI and terminal.
